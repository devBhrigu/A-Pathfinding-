# A-Pathfinding-

Using pygame and python created a visualization for the A* Pathfinding Algorithm. 
Allows user to select start and end nodes. 
Allows user to create barriers. 
Algorithm runs in the background, while the pygame gui shows the most efficient path to reach the end node. 
(Based on real world scenarios with only up, down, left, right no diagnols)
